This project is a web project with the .NET Core framework using Blazor, there are several components, namely Login layout and NavMenu layout.

**Usage**
Login: Navigate to /login to access the login page. Enter your credentials to authenticate.
Navigation: After logging in, use the navigation menu to access different parts of the application.
But, I still can't handle all request on Todo like add, check details, delete, edit, and handle the login page menu.
